What are all the features that this application should include? What is the best UI for this application for the user? I don't want it to have too much empty space. I want it to maximize efficiency for the user and for them to want to use it. What else should be changed/updated for this app?

I would also like to experiment with using nano banana to create an image of their custom keyboard. I would also potentially be using APIs like Amazon's or anything else in order to get links to the different pieces that the user could get to and any other information that would increase a user wanting to use this app.

# Claude Code Prompt: KeebFinder Data Scraper & Database Populator

I need you to scrape all product data from keeb-finder.com and use it to populate my application's database with real, accurate, production-quality data. Before doing anything else, read through my entire codebase to understand the tech stack, database schema, ORM, models, relationships, image handling strategy, and any existing seed scripts or data loaders — your implementation must conform exactly to what already exists.

Before building a scraper, investigate whether keeb-finder.com exposes any hidden API endpoints. It's a Next.js app, so check for `__NEXT_DATA__` JSON payloads embedded in the page HTML, try discovering `/_next/data/<BUILD_ID>/` JSON routes by extracting the build ID from the page source, look for `/api/*` or GraphQL endpoints referenced in their JavaScript bundles, and check their sitemap.xml for a full product URL index. If any of these yield structured JSON data, use that instead of browser-based scraping — it will be faster, more reliable, and less resource-intensive. Only fall back to a headless browser approach (using Playwright, not Puppeteer) if no API or JSON data source is available.

The site has the following product categories, each on its own page: keyboards (`/keyboards`, ~2,193 products), switches (`/switches`, ~700+), mice (`/mice`), keycaps (`/keycaps`, ~1,000+), deskmats (`/deskmats`), stabilizers (`/stabilizers`), cables (`/cables`), wrist rests (`/wrist-rests`), PCBs (`/pcbs`), lubricants (`/lubrications`), and artisan keycaps (`/artisan-keycaps`). All listing pages use infinite scroll or lazy loading, so if scraping the DOM you'll need to scroll until no new products appear. For every single product across every category, extract: the full product name, brand, current price in USD (as a number, not a string), original price if discounted, discount percentage, all image URLs (these are Shopify CDN links like `https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/...` — store the full URLs), the product's keeb-finder.com URL and slug, all purchase/vendor links (the "View on Amazon", "View on Keychron", etc. buttons — store both the vendor name and full affiliate URL), in-stock status, whether it's new or sponsored, all feature tags (like "75%", "Hotswap", "Wireless", "RGB", "Knob", "VIA", "QMK", "Gasket Mount", etc.), and any scores if present (overall, value, build quality, customizability, performance, productivity, portability). For keyboards specifically, also capture layout size, connectivity type, case material, mount style, hot-swap support, knob/screen/RGB presence, QMK/VIA support, hall effect and rapid trigger capability, max polling rate, and battery capacity. For switches, capture the switch type (linear/tactile/clicky), actuation and bottom-out force, pre-travel and total travel distance, factory lube status, pin count, housing and stem materials, spring type, and sound profile. For mice, capture the sensor model, max DPI, weight, connectivity, battery life, shape type, and polling rate. For keycaps, capture the profile, material, legend method, layout compatibility, and key count. If visiting individual product detail pages yields richer data than the listing cards, do that — but be respectful with rate limiting (1-2 second delays between requests) and implement retry logic with exponential backoff.

Before inserting anything into the database, validate and clean the data thoroughly. Deduplicate products by their slug or URL, normalize inconsistent tag names (e.g. "Hotswap" vs "Hot-Swappable" should be unified), confirm all image and purchase URLs are well-formed, ensure prices are stored as numbers, and verify every product has at minimum a name, category, at least one image URL, and a product URL. Any field that isn't available should be null — never fabricate or hallucinate data.

When populating the database, match the scraped data to my existing schema exactly. If brands, categories, tags, or vendors are separate tables, upsert those first and then reference their IDs. Use upsert operations throughout so the script is idempotent and can be safely re-run. Process inserts in batches and log progress as you go. If my schema doesn't have columns for some of the richer fields (like switch-specific specs or keyboard mount style), create a migration to add them — but don't break anything that already exists. For images, store the external Shopify CDN URLs directly unless my app's architecture specifically downloads and stores images locally, in which case download them to the appropriate storage location. At the end, print a summary showing how many products were inserted or updated per category, the total count, and any errors encountered.

Build this as a reusable, well-organized set of scripts (not one monolithic file) with clear separation between the API discovery/scraping layer, the data validation/cleaning layer, and the database insertion layer, so individual parts can be re-run independently. Save intermediate scraped data to JSON files as checkpoints so that if the database insertion fails, I don't have to re-scrape everything. Respect keeb-finder.com's robots.txt and don't overwhelm their servers.

I have a full-site screenshot of a website that I would like you to use as a reference image for the landing page of this application. Where should I put it?

3. And then I also want you to see if there's any better way to scrape the internet for the information that I want. It doesn't necessarily have to come from key finder; I just thought that was the best approach. If you think that there's a better way to get this without running into any errors, or just a better approach to the key finder scraping, then let us do it. I just want to populate my database with accurate, comprehensive data.

Okay, now I want you to complete the landing page. I am also going to include a few copies of this styling code from the website that I used as my previous reference. I want you to combine this styling of the landing page with the current styling of the app. I don't want green at all. Use the landing page image as pure reference as to the kind of vibe I want, but obviously make it applicable to my application and the features that my application has. copy1: [Pasted text #2 +575 lines] copy 2: [Pasted text #3 +576 lines] copy 3: [Pasted text #4 +598 lines]

I would like to go above and beyond and create either an image that shows them their built keyboard, or, on top of that, a 3D rendering that they can look through and turn to see the keyboard. That might just be static, but still 3D. Talk me through this: what are all your recommendations? What are the possibilities? What are the current modern tools that will be able to effectively help me do this?I'm building this application for a hackathon in 48 hours. I wanted to have the best wow factor, but I wanted to actually be feasible.
I don't know much about 3D modeling, but when I do mention it to others, they say that that sounds fantastic. If possible, I would love to do so, but I don't want to overburden myself, so please tell me what do you think is the best approach, the best use of my time, and the best way to win this hackathon? For an application that's basically like Keebfinder with AI elements on top of it, in regards to this visualizer aspect of it.You are building it.

[Pasted text #1 +4 lines] Based on their initial input, the advisor would then ask a series of questions that would really help with the creation of the keyboard. Questions that are valuable, necessary, and effective so that it's actually customized and not generic. For example, color, feel, things kind of similar to what's currently in the build wizard, but I want these to be integrated together. Instead of it looking like a chat bot, I want each question to follow after the other, taking up the screen, so that it's more aesthetic instead of looking like I'm just speaking to a different version of ChatGPT. [Pasted text #2 +2 lines] Also make accessing the link for any of these items very intuitive. Except it's obvious that they can go purchase it, and if for the items in the database that don't currently have a link associated with them, create a link that basically just takes them to Amazon with the title of that item typed in, or just google the name of that item typed in, based on what you think works best. So add light mode and get the default with the current version being considered dark mode. If necessary, create a team of agents to accomplish this task.

--- [Pasted text #1] ---
3D printing is a very big role, but I want it to be more of a focal point for the entire product. This is what allows us to stand out in the other company that we are in this space. I want a majority of the screen to be 3D printed.

On that same note, I want it to be more time. I want to make this model as best as it can be, because, for example, right now I can't see any of the letters on here. It is all just basic shapes, and, in reality, switches have different kinds of shapes and it just chooses to color a certain way. On its own, what I think the user should dictate is what colors to go on.

Also, I don't really like the chat bot looking feature of the bulletin buzzer. I do like having a bulletin buzzer, but I don't want it to be a chat-like feature, because that is kind of outdating. I want the user to be able to type in what they want for their keyboard, and, based on the specifics of what they type in 

--- [Pasted text #2] ---
I want the formatting of the Builder Bazaar output to be much more aesthetic as well. I want it to show up on the screen in rows that make sense, or in another way that makes sense. With each item having a corresponding image that the user can see, and on top of the images I want every single item in this database to have a corresponding image with it.

I'm going to talk to the database. Go through every item in the database. If it currently doesn't have all of the associated traits and characteristics filled out, or it says unknown, I want you to fill it out. If you are filling it out with fabricated information, then I want you to mark that this was filled out with fabricated information only for backend purposes, but don't show that to the user or on the screen. Now remove the out of stock tab, because it seems like everything is out of stock.

[Pasted text #1 +4 lines] Make the nav bar separated by keycap switches, keyboards, and more (call more accessories). Go through the current switch database, because some of the things in there aren't actually switches. There's switch lubricants or something else that isn't a switch, so if it's not, make sure to put those in their respective location. Every single item in the database should have an image. When I go through the database, I should be able to see the image of that item alongside whatever crucial information I want at the top. The buy button, not the build, should be more prominent in this case. Make the My Build section UI correlate to the rest of the application, because right now it's just one long list of really long formatted text. Make it look better and function better and be more aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly, and incorporate some sort of image which can or cannot be the model. Update the web app to use the logo found in the brand assets directory. Maintain its aspect ratio. Create a team of agents if necessary.

--- [Pasted text #1] ---
Make Navbar more pillow-shaped. Change the builder so that all the text boxes and suggestions sit above the 3D image. By above, I mean above it layer-wise, so that the spinning keyboard is in the background, with everything else happening on top of it.

For the individual keys in the 3D model, the text (meaning the letter or the number) is visible on the sides of the cubes as well, which it should not. It should only be visible on the top.

Also make sure that when you are asking the user their preferences, you ask in regards to not only case color but keycap colors. Don't confine yourself to just three to five questions. Okay?

For the Switchy navigation bar, I want a mega menu dropdown system like keeb-finder.com. When a user hovers over a nav tab (like "Keyboards", "Switches", "Keycaps"), a full-width dropdown panel appears below the nav showing multiple columns of filterable categories. Each column has a bold uppercase header (like "TYPE", "FEATURES", "FEEL & SOUND", "BRAND") with clickable text links underneath — no icons, no cards, just clean text lists in a muted gray that darkens on hover. The columns should be evenly spaced across the panel. For Switches: columns for Type (Linear, Tactile, Clicky, Silent, Magnetic), Features (Factory Lubed, Long Pole, 3-Pin, 5-Pin, Dust Proof), Feel & Sound (Low Force, High Force, Thocky, Clacky, Creamy, Poppy), and Brand (Gateron, Cherry, Kailh, Akko, HMX, Durock). For Keyboards: columns for Layout (60%, 65%, 75%, TKL, Full-size, Alice, Split), Features (Hot-swap, Gasket Mount, Top Mount, QMK/VIA, Wireless, Knob, RGB), Use Case (Gaming, Office, Typing, Programming, Beginner, Premium), and Price (Under $50, Under $100, Under $150, Under $200, Under $300). For Keycaps: columns for Profile (Cherry, SA, DSA, XDA, OEM, MT3, KAT, ASA), Material & Brand (PBT, ABS, GMK, ePBT, Akko), and Color. Clicking any link should navigate to the Switch Explorer / Keyboard list / etc. with that filter pre-applied. The dropdown should appear on hover with a slight delay (~150ms) and disappear when the cursor leaves. Dark background panel, consistent with the app's dark theme. Keep it minimal and typographic — no images in the dropdowns, just well-organized text.

Currently, the NavBar has switches, keyboards, accessories, builder, and MyBuilds. I want to update the NavBar so that it has switches, keyboards, key caps, and then accessories, each with their respective drop-down, in the same way that keyboards and switches currently have a drop-down. The accessories drop-down should have things like:
- stabilizers
- springs
- keyboard covers
- case tools
- wrist rest
- anything that doesn't fall into keyboard, key caps, or switches
There are currently items in the keyboard database explorer that aren't actual keyboards but instead accessories. I want you to put these in their respective location over in the accessories area.
I also really like how the switch explorer looks, and I want the keyboard explorer to look the same, with the filters on the left. I also want glossary and group eyes to be their own standalone tabs as well, where both of them are updated to be a lot more effective and beneficial to the application, with a lot more features that the user would use that would make it worthwhile in using this application over any of the competitors.

The Keyboard Explorer currently says that there are 200 items in it, as I look at the UI; however, I can very quickly see that some of these things are not actual keyboards. I would like you to go through the Keyboard Explorer, through everything that's currently being showcased on the Keyboard Explorer, and take out the things that are not actual keyboards. Put them over to where the accessories are, or, if they are key caps, put them into the key caps list. I also want you to populate the Keycaps Explorer and the Accessories databases with more data and images.

You're going to have a lot of fun doing it. Maybe make it so there actually isn't a dividing border between the two. If the user decides to zoom in, that just means that the keyboard might now be flowing under all the text and stuff, but that's perfectly fine.

I also want it: when you click on any of these terms, that may be under where the chat bot will be, it opens up with a picture of what that term can be visualized at. Obviously, it's a layout that shows the keyboard layout; if it's an aluminum case, it shows an aluminum case.

The tags on the group buys are a bit hard to see. If you add an entry to your tracker, it should have the image with it, and if you add one manually, you should have the ability to upload an image of it. Some of the images for the seeded products show a cabin with a sunrise background, which doesn't make any sense. Then the image for a lot of the other ones is the same exact image of a colorful keyboard. Please fix this. Also fix if the image is not working. For example, the Milky Way Onyx 75 image is not working. The Canon Keystack 75 image is not working. For the Ending soon row at the top, make sure that each of those shows the image as well.

When I click on the AI Advisor after putting in my prompt, it starts asking me questions regarding base color and keycap color. The 3D model rotation freezes, and then, as I pick the colors that I want, nothing changes on the 3D rendering. The whole goal of this is that, as the user is clicking certain things, the 3D rendering is changing to show them what their keyboard would look like. That's not working properly.

I need you to investigate that, fix that, and if there's anything that prevents this functionality from happening effectively, I need you to upgrade it, add it, change it, or do whatever you need to do for this to work beautifully. If you believe that the 3D model needs to be drastically upgraded and fixed and add new things so that everything is customizable and can be visually changed, then do so. 

Feel free to create as many agents as you need and as big of a team as you need for this to work. You can change whatever it is that you need to change.

On the glossary page, move the term of the day box to the top right side of the page, and then move the ask switchy box under that, to the bottom right corner of the page. Re-orient UI accordingly, because currently the actual content of the glossary has been pushed down way too much for this initial screen, and I don't like that.

On the right hand side of the My Tracker tab, add a list of recommended group buys to look into that are based off of the user's current tracking list. Making sure to account for whether it is empty and other edge cases. Obviously, make sure that whatever you recommend has the image being displayed associated with it.

Do a complete overhaul of the UI for custom build. A few things to keep in mind, amongst the many other things you should just do to make it better, are:
- For example, when I'm looking at keyboard kit, there are two categories called "Full size" and then there's "Unknown" and then there's a numpad, which I'm pretty sure doesn't make sense.
- I also want images to be shown for whatever we're looking at.Remove the rightmost scrollbar, the main scrollbar, as it just seems to be splitting the screen up right now, and then do whatever else you think makes sense for this UI.

I want you to once again do a sophisticated upgrade of the 3D model of the keyboard. I really love how it's working right now, but I want to make it even better. I want you to figure out how to make it better and then go ahead and make it better, especially given what we're trying to use it for and that the goal is to make this be the main thing that sets our application apart from everything else. One thing for sure is that the emblems on certain keys do not look realistic, such as the shift, the enter, the delete. They look either stretched out or compressed, or something along those lines. Also, the keyboard base seems to be metallic or something like that right now; maybe having the ability to make it matte so that the color really shows, or something like that.

Anyway, I really want some really minute, specific niche updates to this 3D model, along with everything else I think might be beneficial. This is supposed to be a huge wow factor, and it does work effectively now in the bare bone state, but I want it to be absolutely amazing. Run all the agents you need, figure out all the best ways to better this 3D model, and then better the 3D model. Maybe also add a wire poking out the back to resemble a wired keyboard, and then if the user doesn't click, the user clicks wireless, then obviously that gets removed or something like that. I don't know. Do everything that you need to do to make this amazing.

Come in as a critical, blunt mechanical keyboard fanatic that is testing out the builder tab. Test it out, go through it, try it, and give me feedback on the UI:
- what you liked about it
- what you didn't like about it
- on the functionality of the 3D modeling
- what you did like about it
- which you like about it
Be blunt, be critical, and solely focus on telling me everything is wrong and can be changed. I want another agent to take all of that in, analyze it, figure out what to fix, what to change, how to change it, and then create a plan for updating the builder tab and the subcomponents of the builder tab, including the AI builder, etc.

So, looking at the keyboard's directory now, the very first product, which is referred to as a top pick, has a very long text for case material, causing it to double up in line and then making the card for it end up being longer than the other kinds of cards.
