Zoom out even more and reduce the aggressive lighting. I want the line that divides the 3D rendering and the build your dream keyboard to be as invisible as possible. I don't want the keyboard at any moment to seem like it's cut off.

You're going to have a lot of fun doing it. Maybe make it so there actually isn't a dividing border between the two. If the user decides to zoom in, that just means that the keyboard might now be flowing under all the text and stuff, but that's perfectly fine.

Okay, instead for now, what I want you to do is take some from the current database and showcase them as sponsored products, because I want the sponsored products to have an associated image. At the same time, add a rule somewhere in the code base to always remember that I don't want any image placeholders. I want every product that is being showcased on this page to have an associated image.

The sponsored products are way too big on the screen. Use screen shots to see this, and fix it to make it look good and make sense.

--- Prompt 164 [2026-02-22 01:16] ---
Make them slightly bigger, but in a way that makes sense, because I think now it's a little too small. Also remove the thing that shows a fiery emoji with some random product and then a "Shop Now" link. Remove that, and instead put that kind of fire emblem as a tag on the top product or something like that, and then have the products be sorted by recommended as default.Also, make the card of the products that have the promoted tag be outlined so it could kind of stand out from the rest.

I want you to add more functionality to the group buy tab. I want it to also showcase current group buys going on.

I don't want the container around "Build Your Dream Keyboard" and the text box and everything else to blur the keyboard in the background. Update the UI of this to be very aesthetic, with the keyboard in the background spinning in a way that makes sense. It doesn't necessarily interfere with what I'm clicking and typing, and it makes it look weird, but it looks better than it currently does.

--- Prompt 168 [2026-02-22 01:58] ---
I don't like this. I want the chat bot to be more prominent on the page and easily accessible, because the user might completely just miss that widget when they get to the Glossary.

I also want it: when you click on any of these terms, that may be under where the chat bot will be, it opens up with a picture of what that term can be visualized at. Obviously, it's a layout that shows the keyboard layout; if it's an aluminum case, it shows an aluminum case. This means that I would need you to get an image for every single one of these terms; that makes sense. For these updates, make the UI nice. Initiate an agent team if you need to.

The text in UI is a bit difficult to see just on its own. Can you fix this? Make it look more professional and better?

--- Prompt 170 [2026-02-22 02:19] ---
The tags on the group buys are a bit hard to see. If you add an entry to your tracker, it should have the image with it, and if you add one manually, you should have the ability to upload an image of it. Some of the images for the seeded products show a cabin with a sunrise background, which doesn't make any sense. Then the image for a lot of the other ones is the same exact image of a colorful keyboard. Please fix this. Also fix if the image is not working. For example, the Milky Way Onyx 75 image is not working. The Canon Keystack 75 image is not working. For the Ending soon row at the top, make sure that each of those shows the image as well.

When I click on the AI Advisor after putting in my prompt, it starts asking me questions regarding base color and keycap color. The 3D model rotation freezes, and then, as I pick the colors that I want, nothing changes on the 3D rendering. The whole goal of this is that, as the user is clicking certain things, the 3D rendering is changing to show them what their keyboard would look like. That's not working properly.

I need you to investigate that, fix that, and if there's anything that prevents this functionality from happening effectively, I need you to upgrade it, add it, change it, or do whatever you need to do for this to work beautifully. If you believe that the 3D model needs to be drastically upgraded and fixed and add new things so that everything is customizable and can be visually changed, then do so. 

Feel free to create as many agents as you need and as big of a team as you need for this to work. You can change whatever it is that you need to change.

Do a complete overhaul of the UI for custom build. A few things to keep in mind, amongst the many other things you should just do to make it better, are:
- For example, when I'm looking at keyboard kit, there are two categories called "Full size" and then there's "Unknown" and then there's a numpad, which I'm pretty sure doesn't make sense.
- I also want images to be shown for whatever we're looking at.Remove the rightmost scrollbar, the main scrollbar, as it just seems to be splitting the screen up right now, and then do whatever else you think makes sense for this UI.

I want you to once again do a sophisticated upgrade of the 3D model of the keyboard. I really love how it's working right now, but I want to make it even better. I want you to figure out how to make it better and then go ahead and make it better, especially given what we're trying to use it for and that the goal is to make this be the main thing that sets our application apart from everything else. One thing for sure is that the emblems on certain keys do not look realistic, such as the shift, the enter, the delete. They look either stretched out or compressed, or something along those lines. Also, the keyboard base seems to be metallic or something like that right now; maybe having the ability to make it matte so that the color really shows, or something like that.

Anyway, I really want some really minute, specific niche updates to this 3D model, along with everything else I think might be beneficial. This is supposed to be a huge wow factor, and it does work effectively now in the bare bone state, but I want it to be absolutely amazing. Run all the agents you need, figure out all the best ways to better this 3D model, and then better the 3D model. Maybe also add a wire poking out the back to resemble a wired keyboard, and then if the user doesn't click, the user clicks wireless, then obviously that gets removed or something like that. I don't know. Do everything that you need to do to make this amazing.
